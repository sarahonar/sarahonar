👋 Hi, I’m Sara, a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on multi-agent systems, inverse optimal control, and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in how graph-based models can enhance understanding and coordination in complex systems like human-crowd interactions and autonomous navigation.

🔍 I enjoy combining robotics, control theory, and artificial intelligence to solve real-world challenges. My work often involves applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn dynamic interaction weights between agents.

💻 On GitHub, you'll find some of my work on multi-agent systems. I also like contributing to projects that merge robotics and machine learning.

🌍 When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring photography and am passionate about understanding cultures and new experiences.

Feel free to connect or collaborate!
