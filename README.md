- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Sara, a PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on multi-agent systems, inverse optimal control, and machine learning. I'm particularly interested in how graph-based models can enhance understanding and coordination in complex systems like human-crowd interactions and autonomous navigation.
